## ELK stack with python for effective logging	

System logging becomes one of the necessary parts in system design because of the large scale and a wide variety of data information systems are handling. Through this platform, I want to give our techies and other people in the audience an insight into the importance of logging and facilitating its features through ELK stack. ELK stands for Elastic, Logstash and Kibana, Through these 3 technologies, developers can create, store and visualize the working of the systems. These visualization also helps all the stakeholders with the relevant information of the system health. Daily cron or triggers can be set up in order to monitor the health of the system continuously. I am Kartik Sharma, Software Development Engineer in one of the topmost technology companies in India. I have an experience of more than 3 years in designing and development of scalable and robust products that handles more than 20 million transactions per day. My first company Mobikwik, India's 2nd largest E-wallet and payment solutions company, I was being the lead developer for Payment solutions for tech giant Uber. Uber integrated our customized development solution for charging their merchants. This main objective for this project is to implement a scalable and robust solution that can process >200 Transaction per sec. Other projects include Transactions reconciliation mechanisms for Zomato in which the bottleneck was handling scale with spring transaction management properties, implementing a solution transferring exception handling responsibilities to Mysql procedures and thread-based group solutions. My team had faced this problem and figured this as the best solution. 


This seminar will walk through these technologies in brief. Learning the basics of these technologies and working with them collectively. I have divided this presentation giving each technology 10 minutes each, which covers 

1. General introduction 
2. installing and integrating with python
3. Usage tricks

After these technologies, a 5 minutes Q&A session will be there. This presentation is designed for the audience at the beginner level through topics can be advanced depending on the information of the audience in other cases. For further level discussions for the seminar, a rough ppt can be shared containing the topics of the PPT.
