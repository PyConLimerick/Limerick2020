## Adding data visualization to your Flask app with React Victory Charts	

Flask is a web server micro-framework designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. Victory is a set of React.js components for modular charting and data visualization.

This talk will focus on adding data visualization to Flask applications by using the amazing React Victory library.
Presenting data in web applications can be a daunting task, web applications make it very easy to store large amounts of data into your database of choice but many applications struggle with finding a way to display this data in a meaningful way. Server side rendering of charts can work but often lead to a slower and poor user experience.
This talk proposes a solution by integrating a React frontend onto your Flask application, and taking advantage of the powerful and flexible React Victory library for data charting and visualization.

This talk will cover the following topics:
* Discussing the benefits of using a JS frontend.
* Integrate a React frontend into your Flask app.
* Installing and setting up the Webpack, Babel and Victory libraries.
* Creating an API endpoint to send JSON data.
* Fetching API data from your React frontend.
* Some security concerns and how to resolve them.
* Displaying chart data with Victory charts.
