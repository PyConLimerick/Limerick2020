Customer churn prediction and segmentation techniques	


"My project tries to address a common problem in the field of
supermarkets and retail: customer churn.
The work provides some ideas and developments to deal with this problem effectively. The project was conducted on four supermarkets in Italy,
considering the sales figures for 2018.
The work is developed in two main parts:
the first part analyzes some customer segmentation techniques present in the literature, with the aim of developing a customized model to identify the customer churn. The second part is the concrete application of the model of
created, analysis of results and implementation of some predictive models to apply customer loyalty techniques.
The developed model is the result of some customizations of the basic RFM model. The goal is to interpret the behavior of customers, trying toindentify the
significant changes over time."
